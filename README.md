# littlewordcode
a custom programming language interpreter in c++

This is my first attempt at creating a scripting language from the scratch of C++. It is extremely slow (7x slower than python 3.7), and this was an extremely naive attempt. It supports functions (with args and return), loops, and conditionals. If you would like to see something around than 20x faster than this, check out my "langwc" repo, which is far less naive and actually uses a parser + AST.

**It should be noted that the codebase for this project is a MESS, and if you want something readable, again, look at langwc (https://github.com/Drewlark/langwc) - which is just a much, much better (and faster) version of this.**
