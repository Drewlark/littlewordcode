# littlewordcode
a custom programming language interpreter in c++

This is my first attempt at creating a scripting language from the scratch of C++. It is extremely slow (7x slower than python 3.7), and this was an extremely naive attempt. It supports functions (with args and return), loops, and conditionals. If you would like to see something more than 20x faster than this, check out my "langwc" repo.
